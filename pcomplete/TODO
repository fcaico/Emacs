* the whatprovides completion list should be cached (for rpm)

* ganging of options fouls completion for rpm (rpm -qf <TAB>)

* in cvs completion "editors" should constrain to watched files only

* don't include text after point as part of the completion unless
  `pcomplete-complete-whole-argument' is non-nil.  In which case
  `pcomplete-complete-parse-arguments' would call `end-of-line' (or
  `end-of-argument') before calling the parser

* if the cvs command is "cvs -d server checkout <tab>", it shouldn't
  try to look in the CVS directory from PWD

* use syntax highlighting to show when a certain kind of element has
  been completed, such as switches, command names, error arguments,
  etc.  It will need a text-change hook to remove the highlighting if
  the user backspaces over the text at all.

* add a feature which makes pcomplete globally available

* If . is not in the path, and I enter "too<tab>", it doesn't complete
  the tools32 directory

* instead of pcomplete-help being a local variable, it should be
  another argument to pcomplete--here, such as :help-man, :help-info,
  etc.

* add predicate for some command completions.  For example, rm should
  only complete in directories the user has access to, and files the
  user has the right to remove.
