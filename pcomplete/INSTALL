Installing Pcomplete
====================

1. Edit the file `Makefile' in the directory containing the Pcomplete
   sources to reflect the location of certain Emacs dircetories at
   your site.  The only things you really have to change is the
   definitions of `lispdir'.  The elisp files will be copied to
   `lispdir'.

2. Type `make install' in the directory containing the Pcomplete
   sources.  This will byte-compile all of the `.el' files and copy
   both the source and compiled versions to the directories specified
   in the previous step.

   If you only want to create the compiled elisp files, but don't want
   to install them, you can type just `make' instead.

3. Add the directory into which Pcomplete was installed to your
   `load-path' variable.  This can be done by adding the following
   line to your .emacs file:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/pcomplete")

   The actual directory on your system may differ.

4. To install Pcomplete privately, edit your .emacs file; to install
   Pcomplete site-wide, edit the file `site-start.el' in your
   site-lisp directory (usually `/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp' or
   something similar).  In either case enter the following line into
   the appropriate file:

     (load "pcmpl-auto")

5. Restart Emacs.
