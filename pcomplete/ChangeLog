	* pcmpl-gnu.el (pcomplete/tar): use tar-mode to read the contents
	of a tar file.  Only complete names internal to the tar file in
	extraction mode.  Otherwise, complete against filesystem entries.

2000-03-03  John Wiegley  <johnw@gnu.org>

	* pcomplete.el (pcomplete-window-restore-timer): this variable
	needs to be buffer local.

2000-02-10  John Wiegley  <johnw@gnu.org>

	* pcomplete.el: Released 1.1.3.

	* pcmpl-linux.el (pcomplete/umount): Fixed a mispelling, which
	caused an unknown function to be called.

2000-02-03  John Wiegley  <johnw@gnu.org>

	* pcomplete.el: Released 1.1.2.

	* pcomplete.el (pcomplete-do-complete): improved the paring
	algorithm, since it wasn't working in all cases (especially when
	symlinks were involved).

	* pcmpl-unix.el (pcomplete/rm): don't pare symbolic links, since
	the user might want to remove both the link, and what it points
	to.

	* pcmpl-gnu.el: added completion support for bzip2.

	* Makefile: removed unnecessary `add-to-list' code.
	(install_elc): install pcmpl-auto.el.

	* INSTALL: added this file.

1999-12-06  John Wiegley  <johnw@gnu.org>

	* pcomplete.el (pcomplete-version): Released 1.1.1.

	* pcomplete.el (pcomplete-dirs-or-entries): in the first call to
	`pcomplete-entries', `pcomplete-stub' needs to be guarded from
	change
	(pcomplete-version): added version variable

	* pcmpl-gnu.el (pcomplete/gzip): made the completions for 'gzip
	-t' the same as that for 'gzip -d'
