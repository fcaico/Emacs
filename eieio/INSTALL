Installation instructions for Eieio

The following updates to your .emacs file will help you get the most out of this
update of eieio.

1) Build eieio

   On the unix command line, type:

   $ make

   On windows NT, you will need to byte compile each file from within
   emacs, or you can leave everything unbyte compiled.


2) Add eieio's directory to your load path.

   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/eieio-X.XX")

   Be sure to replace the directory above with the actual path to
   where eieio was unpacked.  This will make sure the latest version
   of eieio superceeds any version already installed on your system.
