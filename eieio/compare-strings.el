  "Compare the contents of two strings, converting to multibyte if needed.
In string STR1, skip the first START1 characters and stop at END1.

END1 and END2 default to the full lengths of the respective strings.

Case is significant in this comparison if IGNORE-CASE is nil.
Unibyte strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.

The value is t if the strings (or specified portions) match.
If string STR1 is less, the value is a negative number N;
  - 1 - N is the number of characters that match at the beginning.
If string STR1 is greater, the value is a positive number N;
