These are my C# mode file changes, along with changes to support
ASP+ from html.

For users new to emacs, here's some quick steps to get up and
running:

1) download a copy of Gnu Emacs, I suggest from
   http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html 
2) if you perform the default install you should now be setup on
   c:\emacs
3) extract these files into c:\emacs\site-lisp

4) Look at the enclosed CSharp.emacs, rename it to c:\.emacs, and
   then edit the contents as appropriate for yourself

And you should be up and running...
